## Overview

### The challenge

Users _theorically should_ be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

In case it doesn't work, I'll try to fix it...

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### What I learned

I kinda learned a way to fix an issue I often had while I was making the desktop view... It's basically just adding a div... Kinda sad, actually. But still, I did it :D

### Continued development

Well, I need to get better at going from mobile to desktop and viceversa, there are some datails that made me think about it...
